Applications of SAT Solvers in Cryptanalysis: SAT based attacks on different versions of AES

This repo contains toy versions of MINI-AES and SR*(4, 2, 2, 4) encryption and SAT based attacks (key recovery) implementations. The same is tried for AES-128.
First, use x-encryptor program to generate pairs of plaintext/ciphertext by introducing a pair of plaintext/key, then introduce into x-keyfinder program the obtained plaintext/ciphertext key to test key recovery.
